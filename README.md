## 📌 Project Title
**Mastering SQL Window Functions Like Pros** 🚀

---

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the power of **SQL Window Functions** through a series of real-world analytical queries. We use a mock employee dataset to:
- Compare records with `LAG()` and `LEAD()`
- Rank data using `RANK()` and `DENSE_RANK()`
- Extract top and earliest records using `RANK()` and `ROW_NUMBER()`
- Use `MAX()` with `PARTITION BY` for aggregation
- Provide real-life applications
- Document and visualize our queries with results

## 📊 Dataset Overview
Our project is based on a fictional `employees` table with the following structure:

| Column      | Description             |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| emp_id      | Unique Employee ID      |
| emp_name    | Employee's Name         |
| department  | Department Name         |
| salary      | Monthly Salary          |
| hire_date   | Date Hired              |

---

## 🏗️ Table Creation & Sample Data Insertion
**File**: `create_table_and_insert_data.sql`

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  emp_name VARCHAR(100),
  department VARCHAR(50),
  salary INT,
  hire_date DATE
);

```sql

INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'HR', 'East', 5000, TO_DATE('2020-01-10', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (2, 'Bob', 'HR', 'East', 5200, TO_DATE('2021-03-15', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (3, 'Charlie', 'IT', 'West', 6500, TO_DATE('2020-06-20', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (4, 'David', 'IT', 'West', 6500, TO_DATE('2021-04-12', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (5, 'Eve', 'Finance', 'East', 7000, TO_DATE('2019-11-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (6, 'Frank', 'Finance', 'West', 6900, TO_DATE('2022-02-10', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (7, 'Grace', 'HR', 'East', 5300, TO_DATE('2022-05-05', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (8, 'Hank', 'Finance', 'East', 7000, TO_DATE('2023-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));

```

### 📝 Explanation
We created a simple but realistic dataset of employees, distributed across different departments with varied salaries and hire dates. This setup helps in performing accurate window function analysis.

## 1️⃣ Compare with Previous and Next Records – `LAG()` & `LEAD()`
**File**: `lag_lead_comparison.sql`

```sql
SELECT emp_id,
       emp_name,
       department,
       region,
       salary,
       hire_date,
       salary - LAG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY emp_id) AS diff_prev,
       salary - LEAD(salary) OVER (ORDER BY emp_id) AS diff_next,
       CASE 
           WHEN salary > LAG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY emp_id) THEN 'HIGHER'
           WHEN salary < LAG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY emp_id) THEN 'LOWER'
           ELSE 'EQUAL'
       END AS compare_prev
FROM employees;
```

### 📝 Explanation
Compares current salary to the previous and next salary within each department.

### ✅ Real-life Use
Useful for HR departments to track salary progression.

---

## 2️⃣ Rank Within Each Department – `RANK()` & `DENSE_RANK()`
**File**: `ranking_within_category.sql`

```sql
SELECT 
  emp_id, emp_name, department, salary,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank_standard,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank_dense
FROM employees;
```

### 📝 Explanation
- `RANK()` skips ranks for ties
- `DENSE_RANK()` doesn’t skip any rank numbers

### 📸 Screenshot of Output
`Insert your screenshot here`

### ✅ Real-life Use
Determine fair ranking among employees or students.

---

## 3️⃣ Top 3 Salaries per Department
**File**: `top_3_per_category.sql`

```sql
WITH ranked_emps AS (
  SELECT emp_id,
         emp_name,
         department,
         region,
         salary,
         hire_date,
         RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank_position
  FROM employees
)
SELECT * FROM ranked_emps
WHERE rank_position <= 3;
```

### 📝 Explanation
Uses a CTE to rank and filter top 3 earners per department.

### 📸 Screenshot of Output

### ✅ Real-life Use
Performance reviews and rewards allocation.

---

## 4️⃣ First 2 Employees per Department – `ROW_NUMBER()`
**File**: `earliest_records.sql`

```sql
WITH first_emps AS (
  SELECT emp_id,
         emp_name,
         department,
         region,
         salary,
         hire_date,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY hire_date) AS row_num
  FROM employees
)
SELECT * FROM first_emps
WHERE row_num <= 2;
```

### 📝 Explanation
Finds the first two employees to be hired in each department.

### 📸 Screenshot of Output
`Insert your screenshot here`

### ✅ Real-life Use
Identify veteran staff or earliest customers.

---

## 5️⃣ Aggregation with Window Functions – `MAX()` OVER
**File**: `windowed_aggregation.sql`

```sql
SELECT 
  emp_id, emp_name, department, salary,
  MAX(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) AS dept_max_salary,
  MAX(salary) OVER () AS overall_max_salary
FROM employees;
```

### 📝 Explanation
Displays maximum salaries per department and across the whole company.

### 📸 Screenshot of Output
`Insert your screenshot here`

### ✅ Real-life Use
Benchmarking salary standards across teams.
